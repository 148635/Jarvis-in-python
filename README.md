# Jarvis-in-python
Creating an AI assistant called Jarvis in python using  different packages.
Hi friends.This is my first project in github.
My project is about creating an AI Assistant like Jarvis which is very famous from our Iron Man(Tont Stark).
I Wrote my code by looking into different resources and references.
My jarvis basically do the following:

2.speak the command that we give.
3.get ip address.
4.open notepad.
5.open youtube.
6.play music in different websites like wynk.
